I’ve learned a lot of things in CS1 but I don’t remember how to do most of them. One thing I do remember is how to publish a website using terminal. The first time we did it I was a little bit confused but now I understand how to do it. I finished coding the layout of my website. I’m not really sure that I like it, but I’m still proud that I was able to make it. </div>

We just learned about variables and functions but I’m still not sure how they work. At first, my function wasn’t working, but with the help of a classmate, I was able to fix it. In my code sketch, I have my function continuously print pictures of Bart Simpson. </div>

	I’m starting to feel more comfortable with functions. I don’t always remember how to format some things so I have to go back to my other codes to know what to put. I’m starting to work on the project that I’m giving to my sister over winter break. I’m still trying to figure out how I want to set up some parts of it, but I now have a good understanding of what I want it to be. </div>

I don't really like the design of my website so I've been trying to figure out some things that I could do that can make it more appealing.

I’m making a gift for my sister where you spin a wheel to randomly get a Christmas movie. So far I’ve created the wheel and have set it to spin. I want to make a lab with Molly so that she could help me with the next step of my project.</div>

I’ve learned a lot of things in CS1 but I don’t remember how to do most of them. One thing I do remember is how to publish a website using terminal. The first time we did it I was a little bit confused but now I understand how to do it. I finished coding the layout of my website. I’m not really sure that I like it, but I’m still proud that I was able to make it. </div>

We just learned about variables and functions but I’m still not sure how they work. At first, my function wasn’t working, but with the help of a classmate, I was able to fix it. In my code sketch, I have my function continuously print pictures of Bart Simpson. </div>

	I’m starting to feel more comfortable with functions. I don’t always remember how to format some things so I have to go back to my other codes to know what to put. I’m starting to work on the project that I’m giving to my sister over winter break. I’m still trying to figure out how I want to set up some parts of it, but I now have a good understanding of what I want it to be. </div>

I don't really like the design of my website so I've been trying to figure out some things that I could do that can make it more appealing.

I’m making a gift for my sister where you spin a wheel to randomly get a Christmas movie. So far I’ve created the wheel and have set it to spin. I want to make a lab with Molly so that she could help me with the next step of my project.</div>

I worked  to create a valentine's day puzzle that combines 4 photos into one larger one. I used an event listener so that when you click on a photo it allows you to move it. At first, I wanted it so that the photos would also be in the shape of a heart, but all the different ways I tried never seemed to work. I'm a little bit disappointed with that but it's not that big a deal.  </div>

I spent an hour experimenting with reveal.js. I looked at the demo in hopes of understanding it not that didn't really work... I decided I wanted to make a slideshow/presnetation of the survivor winners. I wanted to do it so that when you scrolled it would show pictures of the winners in order but I couldn't figure out how to do that so instead I jleft it in the form that it came in and made presentation of my favorite movies. </div>

I made my thank you "card" for my sister. It was pretty simple. I just made it so that when you clicked on a different photo of her it would say something I'm thankful for of her. </div>
